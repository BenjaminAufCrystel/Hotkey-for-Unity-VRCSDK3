everyone starts small.

I searched for a script for a hotkey for a long time, but never got a result until I asked someone: he explained it to me, I wrote it and I want to spread it further so that others see this script.

# how function this script

When You Would Activate a Object this script must have an object
with "public GameObject Target;"

(Input.GetKeyDown(THEKEY)) on THEKEY can you place Youre Key What You Would have as Hotkey 



        {
            Target.SetActive(!Target.activeSelf);         This is for Activating The Object you can change it with a Light 
        }


worst explanation of all time i know xd
